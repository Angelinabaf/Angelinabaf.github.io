## A/B Test Analysis for GloBox Website.
By: Anhelina Baftalovska


### Summary
In this A/B test analysis of the GloBox website, two versions of a web page were compared: a control group without a banner and a treatment group with a food and drink banner at the top of the website. The analysis focused on the metrics of conversion rate and average amount spent per user.
The results indicate that users who were exposed to the banner had a significantly higher conversion rate compared to the control group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the average amount spent per user between the two groups.
Further analysis revealed insights based on different factors such as device type, gender, and region/country. These insights provide a preliminary understanding of user behavior, but more comprehensive data on user demographics and campaign targeting would be beneficial.
Additionally, a power analysis and join curve forecast suggest that a larger sample size would be required to achieve sufficient statistical power and accurately capture the desired effects. Therefore, it is recommended to rerun the test at a larger scale to ensure more reliable results.
In summary, based on the significant difference in conversion rate and the potential for acquiring more paying customers, it is recommended to launch the banner feature. However, further data analysis and a larger sample size are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of the banner's impact and optimize its effectiveness in generating higher revenue. Improvements can be made by considering additional user factors and conducting a more extensive power analysis.
